# Pricing altcoin prediction markets from BTC options

Kalshi lists a daily ladder of contracts for SOL, XRP and DOGE: "will the price be above K at 5 pm ET?" These coins have no liquid options market, so nothing anchors the ladder prices, and they trade 5 to 70 times less than the ETH ladder. I asked whether a crypto factor model can price them better than the market. The model takes BTC's forward-looking volatility from the options market, maps it to each altcoin through a beta that is steeper when BTC falls, and adjusts the altcoin's own risk by funding crowding and the Fear & Greed regime.

**Answer.**
- **Models beat the market on the thin ladders.** Over 1,117 Kalshi ladders from August 2025 to October 2026, the factor model's Brier score was 0.130 against the market's 0.138 (Holm p = 0.002). The gap is large for XRP and DOGE and close to zero for SOL. It held in every sensitivity check.
- **The thinner the ladder, the worse the market prices it.** On DOGE, about $290 trades per ladder, and the market lost to every model. On ETH, about $20,600 trades per ladder, and the market beat every model.
- **BTC options are a working substitute for missing options.** On ETH, which does have options, the BTC-based factor model priced contracts almost exactly like ETH's own options (correlation 0.998, no significant score difference).
- **But the factor layers added nothing.** The altcoin's own recent volatility did as well or slightly better (p = 0.066 after adjustment). The steeper down-beta and the funding and mood adjustments did not improve on plain beta.
- **A direction signal did not help either.** Factor models also claim that recent losers bounce back when the market is fearful. Built into the price, this moved a typical contract by 0.02 cents and changed no score. A hint that it was larger for these three coins did not hold on 2020 to 2025 data.
- **Money.** Buying on Kalshi whenever the model priced a contract at least 4 cents above the trade price plus the fee returned +4.7% per dollar (95% interval 1.1% to 8.8%): +8.6% on XRP, +7.0% on DOGE and +0.8% on SOL. This assumes we could have traded at each printed price, which is optimistic.

**Part 2: [Does the crowd know touching is twice as likely?](part2-btc-touch-markets/README.md)** Polymarket's BTC "will it hit $X" markets ($1.2 billion traded) priced against Deribit's options and Kalshi's BTC ladders. On this busy market the crowd is as accurate as the options market, its small premium depends on which option model you use, crowding and mood signals do not move it, and an apparent arbitrage against Kalshi turns out to be the two venues' bid-ask spreads. Thin crowds lose to simple models (part 1); deep ones do not (part 2).

The plan, every model and every test were written in `research.md` before any model was compared with any outcome. Two amendments, both made before any score, are dated there. The two follow-ups on the direction signal were planned after the main results and are labeled as such.

## What this means for a crypto risk platform

A crypto risk platform built on a factor model forecasts risk mostly from history and covers many coins that have no options market. Both parts of this project speak to that:

1. **Forward-looking risk for coins without options.** Carrying BTC's option-implied volatility to an altcoin through its beta and its own residual risk (the market and residual-volatility structure of the Q-7 model) gave a forward-looking risk estimate that matched ETH's own options almost exactly (correlation 0.998). The same route works for any coin with a price history.
2. **Market prices beat history for short-window crash odds.** For "will BTC fall to $X today or this week", Polymarket's price and the options value were each about 10% more accurate than the same probability built from BTC's past volatility (part 2, Holm p = 0.001). For monthly windows and drops of 5% or more, history did as well. A risk screen could show market-implied drawdown odds next to its historical stress tests.
3. **Which crowd prices to trust.** Busy markets (Polymarket's BTC touch markets, Kalshi's ETH ladders) were as accurate as options. Thin ones (Kalshi's DOGE and XRP ladders) were not, and should be used only with a liquidity filter.
4. **Where regime and crowding signals fit.** The Fear & Greed regime and funding-crowding signals added nothing at horizons of hours to a day, in any of the tests. They belong in attribution and longer-horizon risk, not in short-term forecasts.

## Why it matters

Prediction markets now list daily price ladders for many coins, but only BTC and ETH have options markets to anchor a fair value. For BTC and ETH, reading these contracts as digital options is established ([Lee, Lee and Lee 2026](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6748186)). Crypto factor models, from market, size and momentum ([Liu, Tsyvinski and Wu 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13119)) to the seven-factor Q-7 model with residual volatility, funding and sentiment regimes (see below), are built to describe risk. This project tests whether such a model can serve as a pricing engine where no options exist. I found no prior work that prices altcoin prediction-market contracts this way.

## How this builds on the Q-7 model

This project starts from the Q-7 model ([Babayev and Aliyev 2026, "Crypto Has Fundamentals: A Seven-Factor Model for Digital Asset Returns"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6818558)). Q-7 explains crypto returns with seven factors (market, size, momentum, on-chain quality, value, residual volatility and perpetual funding sentiment) and reports that some factor premia depend on the Fear & Greed regime, most strongly that short-term reversal pays in fear and loses in greed. Q-7 is built to explain returns and attribute portfolio performance. This project asks a different question: do its ingredients help price short-dated prediction-market contracts, and do its signals predict when the betting crowd is wrong?

| Q-7 ingredient | How it was used here | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Market factor (beta to BTC) | Maps BTC's option-implied volatility to each altcoin (part 1) | Works: on ETH it matched ETH's own options (correlation 0.998) |
| Residual volatility | The altcoin's own risk on top of its BTC exposure (part 1) | Works, but no better than the coin's own total volatility |
| Funding sentiment | Scales residual risk when futures are crowded (part 1); predicts the crowd's pricing errors on Kalshi BTC ladders (pilot) and Polymarket touch premiums (part 2) | No improvement, no prediction |
| Fear & Greed regimes | The same three uses | No improvement, no prediction |
| Reversal in fear, Q-7's headline regime result | Shifts the center of each ladder's price distribution (part 1 follow-up); tested on 2020 to 2025 daily moves of SOL, XRP and DOGE | The shift is a fraction of a cent; not significant on earlier data |
| Size, momentum, on-chain quality, value | Not used: they rank tokens against each other, while each ladder is one coin over hours | |

The short version: Q-7's market and residual-volatility structure is a sound way to carry an options forecast to coins without options, but its regime and crowding signals add nothing at a horizon of hours to a day. That fits its design for explaining returns across tokens rather than pricing one coin over a few hours.

## Data

All public, downloaded 2026-11-06:
- **Kalshi** KXSOLD, KXXRPD, KXDOGED and KXETHD events closing at 5 pm ET, with market metadata and trades from the public Trade API v2. Settlement is the 60-second average of the CF Benchmarks real-time index before 5 pm ET. Trades were fetched for strikes within 10% of spot when the ladder listed.
- **Polymarket** SOL and XRP daily "above K at 12:00 ET" ladders, May to October 2026, with trades from the public data API v2 (time, price, size and outcome only).
- **Binance** spot 1-minute and 1-hour klines for BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP and DOGE, USDT-M funding rates, and daily klines for every USDT spot pair since 2019-09, including delisted ones ([public archive](https://data.binance.vision)).
- **Deribit DVOL**, BTC's and ETH's 30-day implied volatility index, hourly (public API).
- **Alternative.me Fear & Greed index**, daily.

## Method

A **print** is a Kalshi trade with 1 to 24 hours left to the close and a price from 5 to 95 cents. Each print's price is the market's probability. Every model gives its own probability for the same contract at the same moment, using only data from before the print:

| Model | Probability that the coin closes above K |
| --- | --- |
| Market | The trade price |
| Own volatility | The coin's own recent volatility (HAR: 1, 7 and 30 days of hourly returns), fat-tailed Student-t |
| Beta | BTC's distribution from its options (DVOL, rescaled by the past 90 days' realized moves), times the coin's 30-day beta to BTC, plus the coin's own residual risk |
| Crash beta | The same, with a steeper beta for BTC falls than for rises |
| Factor model | Crash beta, with the residual risk scaled by what past days in the same Fear & Greed regime and funding-crowding state looked like |

Scores: Brier score per print, weighted by contracts within each ladder, then averaged across ladders. Comparisons use a bootstrap over blocks of 10 days and a Holm adjustment over three primary tests.

## Results

**Primary test: SOL, XRP and DOGE on Kalshi** (1,117 ladders, 455 days, 193,247 prints).

| Model | Brier score | Factor model minus this | 95% interval | Holm p |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Market | 0.1377 | -0.0075 | -0.0105 to -0.0042 | 0.002 |
| Own volatility | 0.1293 | +0.0010 | +0.0001 to +0.0019 | 0.066 |
| Beta | 0.1299 | +0.0004 | -0.0001 to +0.0008 | 0.093 |
| Crash beta | 0.1302 | | | |
| Factor model | 0.1303 | | | |

**By coin and venue.** "Market edge" is the market's Brier score minus the own-volatility model's; positive means the market was worse.

| Ladder | Ladders | Median $ per ladder | Market | Own volatility | Factor model | Market edge | Factor vs market, p |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| DOGE, Kalshi | 428 | 290 | 0.1418 | 0.1288 | 0.1305 | +0.0129 | 0.006 |
| XRP, Kalshi | 374 | 1,980 | 0.1363 | 0.1274 | 0.1274 | +0.0088 | 0.003 |
| SOL, Kalshi | 315 | 4,140 | 0.1340 | 0.1321 | 0.1333 | +0.0019 | 0.67 |
| ETH, Kalshi (check) | 456 | 20,560 | 0.1327 | 0.1338 | 0.1357 | -0.0011 | market better, 0.018 |
| XRP, Polymarket | 158 | 1,260 | 0.1213 | 0.1102 | 0.1094 | +0.0111 | 0.36 |
| SOL, Polymarket | 158 | 1,800 | 0.0974 | 0.0949 | 0.0962 | +0.0025 | 0.46 |

The ordering by liquidity is descriptive and was noticed after the results; it was not a planned test. With six points, two venues and correlated coins, it is a pattern to check, not a finding.

**ETH check.** On ETH the factor model, built from BTC's options, and ETHOPT, built from ETH's own options, scored 0.1357 and 0.1359 (difference -0.0002, 95% interval -0.0010 to 0.0006). Their probabilities correlate at 0.998. Where an options market exists, mapping from BTC loses nothing, so the mapping is a fair stand-in where none exists. On ETH, though, the market beat every model.

**Sensitivities** (fixed in advance; factor model minus market, Holm p):

| Variant | Difference | Holm p |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Equal weight per print | -0.0061 | 0.002 |
| At least 3 hours to the close | -0.0075 | 0.002 |
| Prices from 10 to 90 cents | -0.0083 | 0.002 |
| Without the first 90 days | -0.0076 | 0.002 |

**Trading rule (secondary).** At each print, buy the side the model prices at least 4 cents above the price plus Kalshi's taker fee (0.07 × p × (1 - p)). Take half the print's contracts, at most $200 per print, and hold to settlement.

| Venue and coin | Return per dollar | 95% interval | Days traded | Profit | Capital used over the period |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Kalshi, all three (factor model) | +4.7% | +1.1% to +8.8% | 453 | $57k | $1.21M |
| Kalshi, all three (own volatility) | +4.5% | +1.0% to +8.1% | 454 | $58k | $1.30M |
| XRP | +8.6% | +3.8% to +13.5% | 372 | $45k | $0.52M |
| DOGE | +7.0% | +0.5% to +13.1% | 422 | $8k | $0.11M |
| SOL | +0.8% | -4.5% to +5.9% | 314 | $5k | $0.57M |
| ETH (check) | +2.5% | -0.4% to +5.5% | 455 | $59k | $2.30M |
| Polymarket SOL and XRP | -0.4% | -6.2% to +5.0% | 159 | -$1k | $0.23M |

This rule trades at prices that someone else already got, so real returns would be lower. It shows that the scoring gap is large enough to matter after fees, mainly on XRP.

## Follow-up: does a direction signal help?

The factor model above uses only the risk side of crypto factor models. Those models also make a return-side claim: short-term reversal, where tokens that fell over the past three weeks beat recent winners, pays when the market is fearful and loses when it is greedy. If that holds, a ladder's fair price should lean up for a recent loser on a fearful day. Both tests below were planned in `research.md` after the main results and before the signal was computed.

**Signal.** Minus the coin's return from 22 to 2 days ago, standardized against every liquid Binance spot token that day (including tokens delisted since; a median of 210 tokens a day in 2020 to 2025 and 156 in the ladder period). The regime is the 30-day average of the Fear & Greed index before the day: fear below 35, greed above 65. Each day, the cross-sectional slope of the day's return on the signal is measured; the drift used for a ladder is the average slope over earlier days in the same regime within a year, times the coin's signal, times the fraction of a day left.

**On the ladders** (same prints, weights and bootstrap as the primary test):

| Comparison | Difference in Brier score | 95% interval | Holm p |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Factor model with the drift, minus without | 0.00000 | -0.00003 to +0.00003 | 1.00 |
| Market price plus the drift's change, minus market | +0.00001 | -0.00003 to +0.00004 | 1.00 |

The drift moved a typical contract's fair price by 0.02 cents (90th percentile 0.18 cents), against a taker fee of up to 1.75 cents. The trading rule returned +4.7% per dollar with or without it. Per coin, on ETH, on Polymarket and within each regime, nothing changed. Across the whole market in these months, losers did beat winners (about 0.1% a day per unit of the signal), but in every regime, not mainly in fear (fear minus greed p = 0.77).

**A hint, and the check on earlier data.** In an exploratory look at the ladder days, the three coins' own next-day moves leaned toward reversal in fear about ten times more strongly than the market-wide average, but with intervals that included zero. The check below used only 2020-03 to 2025-07, which the hint never saw, and fixed in advance what would count: a positive fear slope, significant one-sided, and at least 0.13% a day per unit of the signal, the drift needed to cover Kalshi's fee on a 50-cent contract.

| Coins, 2020-03 to 2025-07 | Days | Fear slope, % a day | 95% interval | One-sided p | Greed slope |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| SOL, XRP and DOGE pooled (primary) | 1,774 | +0.13 | -0.24 to +0.52 | 0.26 | -0.03 |
| SOL | 1,644 | -0.16 | -0.86 to +0.58 | 0.67 | +0.08 |
| XRP | 1,774 | -0.15 | -0.63 to +0.30 | 0.73 | -0.22 |
| DOGE | 1,774 | +0.71 | -0.11 to +1.51 | 0.04 | +0.16 |
| Every eligible token, market move removed | 1,774 | +0.07 | -0.10 to +0.20 | 0.17 | -0.00 |

The hint did not hold. The pooled estimate sits at the fee line with an interval three times as wide, and two of the three coins point the wrong way. DOGE's p = 0.04 is one of three uncorrected secondary tests, with SOL and XRP pointing the other way. Fear minus greed is not significant for any group. The conclusion for these markets: at a horizon of hours to a day, the reversal-in-fear effect is too small and too unstable to price or trade a single coin's ladder.

## Limitations and what did not work

- **The factor adjustments did not help.** Steeper down-betas, funding crowding and the Fear & Greed regime did not beat plain beta, and nothing beat the coin's own recent volatility. Over a 1-to-24-hour horizon the coin's own price history already carries the information, and BTC's options add nothing to it.
- **About a year of data** per coin, and the three coins move together. All three fell over the sample, which hurt every forecast that assumes no drift.
- **Prints are not quotes.** A print shows where someone traded, not a price we could have had. The trading results are an upper bound.
- **Settlement basis.** Kalshi settles on CF Benchmarks indices; the models use Binance USDT prices.
- **Polymarket** has only five months of ladders, and its results are not significant.
- **The direction signal** was tested with one definition (the common 22-to-2-day reversal and a 30-day mood average). Other windows or mood labels might differ, but trying many would turn the check into a search.

**Attempts log.** The plan was fixed before any score. Two amendments followed, both before any score, after input checks: weighting prints by contracts, because of bursts of 1-contract prints at nonsense prices right after a ladder lists, and fetching trades only for strikes within 10% of spot, to keep the download near two hours at 3 requests per second. The scoring ran three times. The first two runs were incomplete because of download bugs: DOGE's strikes sit in a different API field, and a zero strike crashed the downloader. In the first run DOGE was missing entirely, and in the second it was partial. The reported numbers are from the third run, with the plan unchanged. DOGE ladders before August 2025, before the price data starts, were dropped as planned. The direction-signal follow-up ran once. Its long check ran once, after two restarts of the token download for network errors (a retry was added for dropped connections, and a failing file is now skipped and retried on the next run); the follow-up reads token data from 2024 only, so the longer download does not change it.

## Where I would like feedback

1. Is the coin's own recent volatility really the right benchmark at a 1-to-24-hour horizon, or would a market maker use something faster, such as intraday realized volatility or the order book?
2. Do you see the same liquidity pattern in other thin prediction-market ladders, and is there a volume level above which the crowd reliably beats simple models?
3. Is there a direction signal that does survive at a one-day horizon for a single large coin, or is a ladder purely a volatility product in practice?
4. Where options do not exist, would you trust a BTC-options mapping (which matched ETH's own options here) for longer horizons, where the coin's own history says less?
