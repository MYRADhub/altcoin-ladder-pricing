# Part 2: Does the crowd know touching is twice as likely?

Part 1, pricing thin altcoin ladders, is in the [repository README](../README.md). Part 1 found that thin crowds lose to simple models; this part asks the same question of one of the busiest crypto prediction markets.

Polymarket runs daily, weekly and monthly BTC markets that pay if Bitcoin *touches* a price at any moment in a window: "Will Bitcoin reach $120,000 on August 15?" For a randomly moving price, touching a level is about twice as likely as finishing beyond it, and options desks price these "one-touch" bets every day. I checked whether the crowd prices them like the options market does, whether crowding and mood signals predict its mistakes, and whether its prices ever break a no-arbitrage bound against Kalshi's BTC ladders.

**Answer.**
- **Yes, the crowd knows.** Over 326 events and 1.87 million trades ($155M traded) from October 2024 to November 2026, Polymarket's touch prices were as accurate as a fair value built from Deribit's BTC options (Brier 0.1090 against 0.1101, difference not significant, p = 0.19) and close to perfectly calibrated. They price touching about 11 to 12 cents above finishing beyond the strike, so the crowd does not treat a touch bet like a closing-price bet.
- **No usable mispricing.** Against the planned fair value (twice the options-implied probability of finishing beyond the strike) the crowd sits 1.7 cents higher on both up and down markets (Holm p = 0.002), but against the textbook barrier formula it sits 1 to 3 cents lower. The two option models disagree with each other by more than the crowd disagrees with either. The only stable pattern is a small long-shot tilt (contracts near 6 cents touch about 4% of the time), smaller than the fee.
- **Mood and crowding do not move it.** The Fear & Greed regime and funding-crowding signals of the Q-7 model ([Babayev and Aliyev 2026, "Crypto Has Fundamentals: A Seven-Factor Model for Digital Asset Returns"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6818558); see the [repository README](../README.md#how-this-builds-on-the-q-7-model)) did not predict the crowd's premium (p from 0.07 to 0.94).
- **No arbitrage against Kalshi.** Polymarket priced a touch below Kalshi's "beyond K at 5 pm" for the same day in 262 of 129,997 paired trades, after fees. None of them survive a check that the two trades were close in time, BTC was flat between them, and the prints were on sides one could trade against: they are the two venues' bid-ask spreads.

The plan was written in `research.md` before any data was downloaded. One amendment (made while downloading, before any data was read) and the attempts log are dated there.

## Why it matters

Touch markets are among Polymarket's busiest crypto products: about $1.2 billion traded across these 336 events. They are barrier options sold to a retail crowd, and a crowd that confuses "touch" with "finish" would leave a large, hedgeable edge. Comparing crypto prediction-market prices with options has been done for closing-price contracts ([Lee, Lee and Lee 2026](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1057521926003601); [arXiv 2606.19517](https://arxiv.org/html/2606.19517); public projects such as [implied-odds-research](https://github.com/tavelarocque/implied-odds-research)), and Kalshi's long-shot bias is documented ([Bürgi, Deng and Whelan 2025](https://www.ucd.ie/economics/t4media/WP2025_19.pdf)). For touch markets I found one informal analysis of a single monthly contract ([podshopguy](https://podshopguy.substack.com/p/polymarket-overprices-volatility)) and no systematic study.

## Data

All public, downloaded 2026-11-06:
- **Polymarket** "What price will Bitcoin hit" events: 243 daily, 70 weekly and 23 monthly, with market rules from the Gamma API and trades from the data API v2 (time, price, size, side and outcome only; no wallet fields).
- **Deribit** every BTC option trade with an expiry within 40 days, with its implied volatility and index price (history API).
- **Binance** BTCUSDT 1-minute klines (the touch markets resolve on these highs and lows), USDT-M funding rates ([public archive](https://data.binance.vision)).
- **Kalshi** KXBTCD 5 pm ET ladders with trades and taker side (Trade API v2).
- **Alternative.me Fear & Greed index.**

My Binance-based reading of each market's rules reproduces Polymarket's resolution on 5,359 of 5,360 markets.

## Method and baseline

A **trade** counts if the window has started, at least an hour is left, the price is between 3 and 97 cents, and the price has not yet touched the strike on Binance. For each trade, the Deribit option trades of the previous hour give a volatility smile per expiry (quadratic in log-moneyness), interpolated in time to the end of the touch window. From it:

| Fair value | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **2 x digital** (primary) | Twice the options-implied probability of finishing beyond the strike: the reflection principle, exact for a driftless continuous price |
| Barrier formula | The closed-form one-touch probability under geometric Brownian motion, with the smile's volatility at the strike |
| Digital | The probability of finishing beyond: a hard lower bound for any touch |

Scores: the market price minus each fair value, weighted by shares within each event, events weighted equally; Brier scores paired by event. Uncertainty from a bootstrap over blocks of 10 days, Holm-adjusted over the three primary tests.

## Results

**Primary** (326 events; reach = up markets, dip = down markets):

| Test | Estimate | 95% interval | Holm p |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Reach: market minus 2 x digital | +1.65 cents | +1.35 to +1.99 | 0.002 |
| Dip: market minus 2 x digital | +1.76 cents | +1.46 to +2.14 | 0.002 |
| Brier: market minus 2 x digital | -0.0011 | -0.0028 to +0.0005 | 0.19 |

**Against the other fair values** (same tests):

| Fair value | Reach | Dip | Brier difference, p |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Barrier formula | -0.99 cents | -3.01 cents | -0.0017, 0.10 |
| Digital (lower bound) | +11.87 cents | +10.92 cents | -0.0271, 0.002 |

The crowd's prices fall between the two option models and well above the lower bound. The 2 x digital value is itself a little too low: contracts it prices at 57 cents touched 63% of the time. The crowd's 57-cent contracts touched 57% of the time.

**By series** (market minus 2 x digital, cents): daily +1.9 reach and +2.1 dip; weekly +0.8 and +1.1; monthly +2.1 and +0.3 (the monthly dip interval includes zero; 23 events).

**Mood and crowding.** The event-level premium, regressed on the standardized 30-day Fear & Greed mean and 7-day BTC funding mean known the day before the window: no slope is significant (reach on funding +0.29 cents per standard deviation, p = 0.09; dip on funding +0.23, p = 0.07; every other p above 0.25). The difference between up and down premiums does not move with either (p = 0.94 and 0.74).

**Trading rule (secondary).** Buying the side the 2 x digital value prices at least 4 cents above the trade price plus the 0.07 × p × (1 - p) fee returned +7.8% per dollar (95% interval -1.6% to +26.9%). Most of the profit came from the 23 monthly events, whose contracts all share one month's path; daily alone returned +4.1% (-2.4% to +8.8%). Not significant, and it assumes fills at printed prices.

**Kalshi bound.** For daily events, each Polymarket trade was paired with the last Kalshi trade within 5 minutes on the same day's 5 pm ladder, at the nearest strike at or beyond the touch strike. If BTC is beyond K at 5 pm it has touched K, so the touch price should never be lower. It was lower by more than both fees plus a cent in 262 of 129,997 pairs (0.2%, on 53 of 228 days, median 6 cents). In an exploratory check added after seeing them, 143 were within 60 seconds with BTC flat, and none were on executable sides: they paired a Polymarket print where someone sold the touch with a Kalshi print where someone bought. Over the whole sample only 3 were on executable sides.

## Limitations and what did not work

- **Model risk is larger than the effect.** The two standard option models disagree by 3 to 5 cents. Calling the crowd "1.7 cents rich" or "1 to 3 cents cheap" depends on the model, so the defensible statement is that the crowd is inside the range of reasonable fair values.
- **Binance is not the options index.** Touch markets resolve on one exchange's 1-minute wicks; Deribit's options settle on a multi-exchange index. Single-exchange wicks make touching slightly easier, which may be why 2 x digital runs low.
- **One path per window.** All strikes of an event share one price path, so the effective sample is the number of events, not trades. Monthly results rest on 23 events.
- **Prints are not quotes.** Trades show where someone traded, not the spread; the trading rule is an upper bound.
- **Attempts log.** Run 1 crashed on 20 weekly markets without their own end date; run 2 crashed at the Kalshi check. Run 3 completed and its numbers were read; the planned resolution check then found three data bugs (269 markets with unrecognized window wording, a strike parser that read a month name as "millions", and window ends an hour off around clock changes) plus five two-sided 2024 markets. After the fixes, run 4 is reported; the model, tests and filters did not change. Run 3 gave +2.25 and +1.78 cents for the two premiums.

## Where I would like feedback

1. Which fair value would a desk use for a 1-day one-touch on BTC: twice the smile digital, a local-volatility barrier price, or something calibrated to realized wicks?
2. Is the crowd's accuracy here surprising to you, given the long-shot bias found on Kalshi, or is a $1M-a-day market simply deep enough to be efficient?
3. Is there a cleaner way to test the touch-versus-terminal bound across venues with only trade prints, without order-book history?
